# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

The goal of this project is to help our developers have a better understanding of the apps that are profitable both on the App Store and Google Play in order to help them design apps that are likely to attract more users.

Our company builds Android and iOS mobile apps which are listed on Google Play and App Store respectively. Our apps are free to download and install, making our revenue model predominantly determined by in-app ads. This means that our revenue is determined by the number of users who patronize our apps. We aim to help our developers have a better understanding of the kinds of apps that appeal our most loyal users in order to replicate our success and attract more users.
